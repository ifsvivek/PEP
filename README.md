-   **Interactive Quizzes**: Automatically generated quizzes with multiple-choice questions to test understanding
-   **Progress Tracking**: Monitor learning progress and quiz scores through a personalized dashboard
-   **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with Tailwind CSS that works across devices

### Advanced Learning Tools

-   **Step-by-Step Learning**: Structured learning paths that break down complex topics into manageable steps
-   **Live Coding Practice**: Interactive coding environment with multiple language support (Python, JavaScript, C)
-   **Code Testing**: Automated test cases validate coding solutions in real-time
-   **AI Coding Hints**: Get intelligent hints when stuck on coding problems

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (Python web framework)
-   **AI/ML**: [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for LLM orchestration with [Groq](https://groq.com/) API
-   **Frontend**: HTML, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), JavaScript
-   **Storage**: JSON-based data persistence

-   Introduction explaining the topic's significance
-   Multiple sections covering key concepts
-   Practical examples for each concept
-   Interactive elements for engagement
-   Key terms with definitions
-   Summary of the main ideas
-   Recommended further reading

## Development

### Content Generation Process

The platform uses two primary AI generation functions:

1. `generate_content(topic)`: Creates educational content including:

    - Introduction
    - 3-4 key concept sections with examples
    - Interactive elements (reflection questions, activities)
    - Key terms and definitions
    - Summary
    - Further reading suggestions

2. `generate_quiz(content)`: Analyzes the content and creates:

    - Multiple-choice questions testing comprehension
    - 4 options per question with one correct answer
    - Balanced coverage of the content material

3. `generate_question(language)`: Creates coding problems with:
    - Clear problem description
    - Template code to get started
    - Test cases for validation
    - Expected inputs and outputs
